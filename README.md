# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
This project uses the Google Maps API and the OpenWeatherMap API to gather temperature and city data for a set of approximately 700 random cities across the globe. This application can be used to plan a vacation based on the type of weather that the user would like. When the user runs this application, they are prompted to enter the maximum and minimum temperatures that they would like to have at their destination. Then, the program populates a Google Map with cities, hotels, and current temperatures within the given range. From there, the user may choose a few destinations and plan their route.
